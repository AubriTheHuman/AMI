This can be used in conjunction with this book to help you determine how much deeper you'll need to go.$(br2)  When right-clicked above sea-level the prospector's pick will inform you if there's a deposit in your general vicinity, and if so, where. Once you're underground, it'll scan a configurable area in the direction you're looking and tell you what you might find."
