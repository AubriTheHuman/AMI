Aubri's Magival Industries (AMI) modpack is a Tech modpack that leans heavily into using multiblock machines to accomplish tasks.

It is for 1.16.5 focused on Create, Immersive Engineering, Astral Sorcery, Botania, and Advanced Rocketry. Create and grow your factory to produce magical items with automation control and long production chains utilizing multiblocks and sequenced assembly!

The project is currently in alpha but so that people (specifically friends) can playtest it, I'm throwing it up on curse now. In its current state, it is only playable as a kitchen sink pack. Once tiers 0-4 are completed, a quest-based version will be released.
Quests for guiding larger production chains coming soon!


This github version is mostly for backing up files, but is still visible for anyone who wants to view it.
